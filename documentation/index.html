        <h2><u>Name</u></h2>

        <p>
            To add a new step to the recipe, click the add step button. A window will appear requesting the name of the step. 
            Once the name has been provided, the step will appear in the steps dropdown menu. New steps are appended to the end of the recipe.

            Once the recipe is complete, click the "Generate" button. A window will appear asking to select a folder where the file will be placed. 
            Once the directory has been provided, the program will begin generating the HTML document. The HTML document will be saved in the folder, 
            and will be called [recipe name].html

    <div id="images" class="section">
        <h2><u>Images</u></h2>
        <h3>Importing images</h3>
        <p>
            Recipes can have images in step text only. Images cannot be in ingredients, recipe names, or step titles. Images can be jpg, jpeg, or png.
            To add an image to a step, click the "Add Image" button. A file dialog will appear asking for the image to be selected. Once the image is 
            selected it will be made available
        </p>
        <h3>Using Images</h3>
        <p>
            To use an image, add the image's tag into a step text. The tag will look like: &lt;#&gt;
            <br>
            The image will appear in the outputted HTML document in the same spot as it was placed in the step. 
        </p>
        <h3>Image Viewer</h3>
        <p>
            To view any images in the program, click the image viewer button. Images will be listed with a tag and "x" button below. The tag will be
            used to put an image in the recipe. The "x" button will delete the image. If an image is deleted, any instance of the image in a recipe will also 
            be removed and replaced with nothing. 
        </p>
        <h3>Cached Images</h3>
        <p>
            When an image is imported, there is a copy stored as a pygame surface (in memory) and used for processing, as base64 (in memory) for html generation, 
            and as a file (on disk) in a tmp directory. When images are deleted then the viewer is exited, the cache is rebuilt. Cache and tmp directory are 
            cleared if the program is properly closed, and if a tmp directory exists on program startup then it is cleared. 
        </p>

        <h2><u>Importing from recipe websites</u></h2>
        <h3>Support Domains</h3>
        <p>The app supports</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ww.com</li>
            <li>weightwatchers.com</li>
            <li>allrecipes.com</li>
            <li>cooking.newyorktimes.com</li>
            <li>sallysbakingaddiction.com</li>
            <li>forksoverknives.com</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Importing</h3>
        <p>To import a recipe, copy the url from a recipe on one of these sites. Click the Import from Website button, 
            answer the question about saving, then paste the URL in the textbox that appears. Press the "X" to submit. 
        </p>
        <h3>Functionality</h3>
        <p>Reading a website is not fast, nor does it always work. If failed, the app will try again, but has a limit of 5 
            attempts. While importing, the attempt is displayed on the screen. If after importing, information is missing, 
            it is possibly due to a restricted internet connection.
